# Interactive Photo Gallery

This project showcases a responsive image gallery with real-time search and lightbox to display a larger version of the image with a caption. 

I wrote JavaScript to allow users to do a real-time search, hiding images that don't have a caption to match the user's search. 

The project uses minimal CSS by using flexbox for the image gallery.
